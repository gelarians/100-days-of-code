compontens ---> actions = this.$store.dispatch("function", payload)
actions ----> mutaitions =  context.commit("FUNCTION", payload)
getters = this.$store.getters.function

**Thoughts:** 
i still have problems deleting individual messages. i think i can't avoid saving them in a database or api so that i can get unique ids

### Day 1: December 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the basics of Websockets. I use socket.io to create a small Chat app. I have worked on a first version and can now send messages from one client to the other clients. The next step is to build an api that saves all messages and adds the ability to delete messages.


**Thoughts:** 
100 days is a long time hopefully i can do it. No i will do it! question of the day: how do I get it to give all messages unice ids without saving them in the database? does anyone have an idea?
