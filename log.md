### Day 4: December 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Start learning VueJS. make my first project with it, a Blizzard game voter ^^
I had a lot of fun with it and learn alot about v-bind, v-for and the general Vue object.


**Thoughts:** Vue JS is better than i thought. the component part is rly cool.

### Day 3: December 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: create a Django/rest api to save the incomming messages from the chatapp. Messages can now be deleted from all clients. export the emoji function.

**Thoughts:** 2 languages and 2 framworks on one day. :D im happy to finished this.

### Day 2: December 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Add emojis to the chat. server checks if a emoji keyword in the input field and change it to the right png. Every client can now change the username. add some style that die emoji and the text are in center.

**Thoughts:** 
i still have problems deleting individual messages. i think i can't avoid saving them in a database or api so that i can get unique ids

### Day 1: December 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the basics of Websockets. I use socket.io to create a small Chat app. I have worked on a first version and can now send messages from one client to the other clients. The next step is to build an api that saves all messages and adds the ability to delete messages.


**Thoughts:** 
100 days is a long time hopefully i can do it. No i will do it! question of the day: how do I get it to give all messages unice ids without saving them in the database? does anyone have an idea?
